# Reader_iOS

The reader app will recognize characters from images. 

I will start with 1 and 0 to then add character from 0-9, and finally a-z.

I'm planning on using depth-first search to look for the different rgb values.

When a second color is found, the i and j index will be stored and then compared to a hardcoded smaller bitmap.
